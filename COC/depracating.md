### **Deprecation Guidelines for the Project**

#### **1. Purpose**
The purpose of these guidelines is to provide a standardized, clear, and structured approach to deprecating features, functions, or components within the project. Proper deprecation ensures that users and developers can transition to updated functionality smoothly, without disruption to the project’s overall integrity and backward compatibility.

#### **2. Deprecation Policy Overview**
Deprecation is the process of marking a feature, function, or component as outdated, signaling that it will be removed or replaced in future versions. Deprecation is necessary when:
- A feature is outdated or obsolete.
- A feature is replaced with a better alternative.
- A feature introduces security risks, technical debt, or maintenance challenges.
- A feature is incompatible with newer versions of the system or underlying technologies.

The deprecation process ensures that users have adequate time to migrate to alternatives and prevents sudden disruptions in service.

#### **3. Deprecation Procedure**

1. **Identifying Features for Deprecation**
   - Features or functions should be evaluated for deprecation when they no longer meet the project's goals or best practices. Before proceeding with deprecation, the development team must confirm that the feature will be replaced with a suitable alternative.
   - Deprecated features should have low usage or should be superseded by new, more efficient functionality.

2. **Implementing Deprecation Warnings**
   - **Code-Level Deprecation Warning**: The feature should raise a `DeprecationWarning` in the codebase when it is accessed, alerting developers and users that the feature will be removed in future releases. The warning should include details on why the feature is deprecated and provide information about the alternative.
   - **Documentation Update**: The project's official documentation should be updated to reflect the deprecation. This includes adding a notice to the deprecated feature’s section, as well as any migration guides or alternative methods. The changelog must include details on the deprecation, specifying the version it was introduced in and when it will be removed.

   Example:
   ```python
   def old_function():
       """
       Deprecated: This function is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
       Please use `new_function` instead.

       Changelog:
       ----------
       v2.4.0:
           - Marked as deprecated. Use `new_function` in future.
       """
       warnings.warn(
           "The 'old_function' is deprecated and will be removed in future versions. Please use 'new_function' instead.",
           DeprecationWarning,
       )
       # Existing implementation
   ```

3. **Deprecation Notification to Users**
   - Users of the software, especially those who interact with public APIs or exposed features, must be notified about the deprecation through various channels, including release notes, email notifications (if applicable), and official blog posts.
   - These communications must clearly explain the reason for the deprecation and encourage users to adopt the new functionality.

4. **Provide Migration Path**
   - A clear and simple migration path should be provided to users of the deprecated feature. This may include example code, step-by-step instructions, or scripts to ease the transition. Migration guides should be included in both the documentation and changelogs.

5. **Deprecation Period**
   - A feature marked for deprecation should be maintained for a reasonable period (e.g., 1-2 release cycles or a minimum of six months) to allow users ample time to transition to the alternative functionality. During this period, the feature should still be operational but should display a deprecation warning whenever it is used.
   - This period provides users with sufficient time to update their systems while maintaining backward compatibility.

6. **Feature Removal**
   - Once the deprecation period has passed, the feature may be fully removed in the next major release. The removal should be clearly documented, and all references to the deprecated feature should be eliminated from the codebase.
   - Any tests, configuration files, or documentation that reference the deprecated feature must also be updated to reflect its removal.

#### **4. Versioning and Deprecation**

- **Minor Versions**: Deprecation should generally occur in minor or patch releases. The aim is to signal changes without breaking backward compatibility.
- **Major Versions**: The actual removal of deprecated features should occur only in major version updates (e.g., v3.0.0), where breaking changes are expected and accepted. The removal should be final, and no deprecated features should remain accessible.

#### **5. Documentation Standards**

1. **Deprecation Notices**:
   - Each deprecated feature must include a clear notice in the documentation indicating its status and the version in which it was deprecated. For functions or components marked for deprecation, include:
     - A warning message.
     - The alternative method or functionality.
     - A timeline for when it will be removed.

   Example of documentation:
   ```markdown
   ## Deprecated: `old_function()`

   **Status**: Deprecated as of version 2.4.0. Will be removed in version 3.0.0.

   **Alternative**: Use `new_function()` instead.

   **Reason for Deprecation**: `old_function()` has been superseded by a more efficient and secure solution. Please migrate to `new_function()` for better performance and support.

   **Migration**: See the [migration guide](link-to-guide) for detailed instructions.
   ```

2. **Changelog**:
   - The changelog should contain entries detailing:
     - The introduction of deprecations.
     - The removal of deprecated features.
     - Any significant changes that users need to be aware of.
   
   Example:
   ```markdown
   ## v2.4.0
   - **Deprecated**: The `old_function()` function has been deprecated. Use `new_function()` instead. Will be removed in version 3.0.0.
   ```

3. **Migration Guides**:
   - A migration guide must be included to assist users in transitioning from deprecated features to the new alternatives. The guide should be comprehensive, including sample code, configuration changes, and common pitfalls.

#### **6. Exception Handling for Deprecated Features**

- If a deprecated feature is accessed after the deprecation notice has been issued, the software should raise a `DeprecationWarning` to inform users about the upcoming removal.
- Once the feature has been fully removed, accessing it should result in an error, typically an `AttributeError` or `ImportError`, with a clear message about the removal and the recommended alternative.

#### **7. Removal of Deprecated Features**

- Once the deprecation period has passed, the feature will be completely removed in the next major release. This involves:
  - Deleting the code, tests, and documentation related to the deprecated feature.
  - Ensuring that no lingering references to the feature remain in the codebase.

#### **8. End-of-Life (EOL) Features**

- If a feature is considered for deprecation due to obsolescence (i.e., it no longer serves a functional purpose or is incompatible with the project’s future goals), it may eventually reach an "end-of-life" (EOL) stage. At this point, the feature will no longer be maintained or supported.
- The EOL process should be communicated clearly and in advance, allowing sufficient time for users to transition.

---

### **Conclusion**

Adhering to a formal deprecation process allows the project to evolve while maintaining stability and compatibility for users. Proper communication, clear migration paths, and timely removal of obsolete features ensure that the project continues to improve without disrupting user workflows. All deprecated features should follow the process outlined above to maintain consistency and transparency throughout the project lifecycle.
