### Class Overview
This documentation covers a set of classes designed for managing demonstrations, organizers, and organizations within a Flask application using MongoDB.

### Functionality Overview
- **Data Management**: Easily manage demonstration events and their associated data (organizers, organizations).
- **Recurring Events**: Support for scheduling and handling recurring demonstrations.
- **Validation**: Ensure data integrity with built-in validation methods.

---

### Classes

#### BaseModel
A mixin class providing common methods for data serialization and deserialization.

**Methods:**
- `from_dict(data: dict)`: Creates an instance from a dictionary.
- `to_dict(json: bool = False)`: Converts an instance to a dictionary format.

---

#### RepeatSchedule
Represents the scheduling frequency for recurring events.

**Attributes:**
- `frequency (str)`: Type of frequency (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly).
- `interval (int)`: Interval count for the frequency.
- `weekday (Optional[datetime])`: Day of the week for weekly events.

**Methods:**
- `__str__()`: Returns a string representation of the repeat schedule.
- `to_dict()`: Converts the schedule to a dictionary.
- `from_dict(data: dict)`: Creates a RepeatSchedule instance from a dictionary.

---

#### Organizer
Represents an organizer for demonstrations.

**Attributes:**
- `name (str)`: Name of the organizer.
- `email (str)`: Email of the organizer.
- `organization_id (ObjectId)`: Reference to the associated organization.
- `website (str)`: Website of the organizer.
- `url (str)`: URL to the organizerâ€™s page.

**Methods:**
- `to_dict(json: bool = False)`: Converts the organizer to a dictionary.
- `fetch_organization_details()`: Retrieves organization details from the database.
- `validate_organization_id()`: Validates the existence of the associated organization.

---

#### Organization
Represents an organization involved in demonstrations.

**Attributes:**
- `name (str)`: Name of the organization.
- `description (str)`: Description of the organization.
- `website (str)`: Website link for the organization.
- `social_media (dict)`: Social media links for the organization.
- `demonstrations (list)`: List of associated demonstrations.
- `users (dict)`: User data associated with the organization.
- `_id (ObjectId)`: Unique identifier for the organization.

**Methods:**
- `save()`: Saves or updates the organization in the database.

---

#### Demonstration
Represents a demonstration event.

**Attributes:**
- `title (str)`: Title of the demonstration.
- `date (str)`: Date of the event.
- `start_time (str)`: Start time of the event.
- `end_time (str)`: End time of the event.
- `facebook (str)`: Facebook link for the event.
- `city (str)`: City where the event will take place.
- `address (str)`: Address of the event.
- `route (str)`: Route for the demonstration if applicable.
- `organizers (list)`: List of organizers associated with the demonstration.
- `approved (bool)`: Approval status of the demonstration.
- `linked_organizations (dict)`: Associated organizations.
- `img (str)`: Image link for the demonstration.
- `_id (ObjectId)`: Unique identifier for the demonstration.
- `description (str)`: Description of the demonstration.
- `tags (list)`: Tags related to the event.
- `created_datetime`: Date and time when the event was created.
- `recurring (bool)`: Indicates if the event is recurring.
- `repeat_schedule (RepeatSchedule)`: Schedule for recurring events.

**Deprecation Notice:**
- The `topic` field has been deprecated since version **2.2.0** and will be completely removed in version **2.3.0**.

**Methods:**
- `to_dict(json: bool = False)`: Converts the demonstration to a dictionary.
- `validate_fields(...)`: Validates required fields for the demonstration.
- `save()`: Saves or updates the demonstration in the database.

---

#### RecurringDemonstration
Extends the `Demonstration` class for managing recurring demonstrations.

**Attributes:**
- `created_until (datetime)`: End date for the recurring events.
- `repeat_schedule (RepeatSchedule)`: Schedule for the recurring events.

**Methods:**
- `calculate_next_dates()`: Calculates the next occurrence dates based on the frequency and interval.

### Example Usage

```python
# Creating an Organizer
organizer_data = {
    "name": "Jane Doe",
    "email": "jane@example.com",
    "organization_id": ObjectId("60d5f9d1e3d1e73f1c9d7201"),
    "website": "http://example.com"
}
organizer = Organizer.from_dict(organizer_data)

# Creating a Demonstration
demo = Demonstration(
    title="Climate March",
    date="2024-03-01",
    start_time="12:00",
    end_time="15:00",
    facebook="http://facebook.com/event",
    city="Helsinki",
    address="Main Street",
    route="Route 66",
    organizers=[organizer],
    approved=True,
    img="http://example.com/image.jpg"
)
demo.save()
```

### Conclusion
This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the classes and their functionalities within the demonstration management system. You can extend this documentation further based on your specific implementation details or user needs.
