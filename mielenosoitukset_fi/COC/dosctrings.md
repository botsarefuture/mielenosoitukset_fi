### **Docstring Guidelines for the Project**

#### **1. Purpose**

The purpose of these guidelines is to provide a clear, consistent structure for writing docstrings throughout the project. Well-written docstrings enhance code readability, improve maintainability, and help both current and future developers understand the functionality and usage of the codebase. Adhering to these guidelines will ensure consistency across the project.

#### **2. General Principles for Writing Docstrings**

1. **Clarity and Conciseness**: Write docstrings in a clear and concise manner. Avoid unnecessary verbosity, and focus on the function’s purpose, arguments, return values, and any side effects.
   
2. **Consistency**: Use a consistent style and format for all docstrings across the project. This includes maintaining the same structure for functions, methods, classes, and modules.

3. **Grammar**: Write docstrings in complete sentences. Use proper grammar, punctuation, and capitalization. The first letter of the docstring should be capitalized, and sentences should end with a period.

4. **Present Tense**: Use the present tense for describing the functionality of a function or method (e.g., "Returns the user's email address" rather than "Returned the user's email address").

#### **3. Docstring Structure**

Each docstring should follow a standard structure. The following sections should be included where appropriate:

1. **Short Description (One-liner)**:
   - A brief summary of what the function, method, or class does.
   - It should be concise but descriptive enough to understand the purpose at a glance.
   - For example: `"Returns the user's email address"`.

2. **Extended Description (Optional)**:
   - If necessary, provide further clarification or details about the function’s behavior, purpose, or usage. This section is especially useful for complex functions.
   - For example: `"This function retrieves the email address associated with the user's account from the database"`.

3. **Arguments**:
   - List each parameter the function accepts. Describe its type and any constraints or expected format.
   - Use the following format for each argument:
     ```
     Args:
         arg_name (type): Description of the argument.
     ```
   - For example:
     ```python
     Args:
         email (str): The email address to validate.
     ```

4. **Returns**:
   - Describe the return value(s) of the function, including their type and what they represent.
   - If the function does not return anything, indicate `None` or omit this section.
     ```python
     Returns:
         bool: True if the email is valid, False otherwise.
     ```

5. **Raises (Exceptions)**:
   - If the function raises exceptions, list them along with a description of the circumstances under which they are raised.
   - For example:
     ```python
     Raises:
         ValueError: If the input email address is invalid.
     ```

6. **Changelog (For Deprecated Functions/Methods)**:
   - For functions or methods that have been deprecated or modified, include a "Changelog" section in the docstring to note the version and details of the change.
   - Example:
     ```python
     Changelog:
     ----------
     v2.4.0:
         - Deprecated this function. Use `new_function` instead.
     ```

7. **Example Usage (Optional)**:
   - If applicable, provide an example usage of the function or method, demonstrating how it should be called and what the expected output is.
   - Example:
     ```python
     Example:
         >>> is_valid_email("test@example.com")
         True
     ```

#### **4. Specific Docstring Formats**

##### **Function Docstring Example**
```python
def is_valid_email(email):
    """
    Validate the given email address.

    Args:
        email (str): The email address to validate.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the email is valid, False otherwise.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the input email address is invalid.

    Changelog:
    ----------
    v2.4.0:
        - Deprecated this function. Use `valid_email` instead.

    Example:
        >>> is_valid_email("test@example.com")
        True
    """
```

##### **Class Docstring Example**
For classes, the docstring should describe the class's purpose and the functionality it provides, followed by the attributes and methods.

```python
class EmailValidator:
    """
    A class to validate email addresses.

    This class provides methods to check whether an email address is valid or not,
    using regular expressions and domain verification.

    Attributes:
        email (str): The email address to be validated.

    Methods:
        is_valid_email(): Validates the email address.
        get_email(): Returns the email address.
    """
```

##### **Module Docstring Example**
For modules, the docstring should describe the module's purpose, its key functions, and any important details about how to use the module.

```python
"""
email_validation.py

This module contains functions to validate email addresses.
It includes basic validation for email formats, and additional
functionality for domain verification.

Functions:
    is_valid_email(): Validates an email address format.
    valid_email(): Checks if an email address is valid.
"""
```

#### **5. Deprecation and Versioning**

For functions or methods that are deprecated or removed, use the following format:

1. **Deprecation Notice**: Include a clear deprecation warning message.
2. **Changelog**: Include a version history to track when the feature was deprecated or removed.

Example for a deprecated function:
```python
def old_function():
    """
    Deprecated: This function is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
    Please use `new_function` instead.

    Changelog:
    ----------
    v2.4.0:
        - Deprecated this function. Use `new_function` in future.
    """
```

For more information on deprecation practices and versioning in this project, please refer to the [Deprecation Guidelines](/COC/depracating.md).

#### **6. Style Guide References**

For more details on Python docstring standards, refer to the following style guides:
- **PEP 257** (Python’s Docstring Convention): [PEP 257 Documentation](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/)
- **Google Python Style Guide**: [Google Python Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#38-comments-and-docstrings)

#### **7. Best Practices**

- **Be Specific**: Be as specific as necessary, but avoid redundancy or overly technical jargon.
- **Think of the User**: Write docstrings for the developer who will use the function, not the author who wrote it. Avoid too much internal implementation detail.
- **Update Regularly**: Keep docstrings up to date with any changes to the function or class. If the function behavior changes, its docstring should reflect that.
- **Avoid Typos**: Proofread docstrings carefully. Typos can confuse developers and may reduce the credibility of the documentation.

### **Conclusion**

Following these docstring guidelines ensures that the codebase remains maintainable, understandable, and accessible to all developers. Clear, consistent docstrings improve collaboration and reduce errors by providing clear guidance on how to use and interact with the code.
