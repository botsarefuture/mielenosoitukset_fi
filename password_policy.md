Minimum Length:

Passwords must be at least 12 characters long.

Special characters (!@#$%^&*()-_=+[]{};:,.<>?)

Prohibited Content:

Passwords cannot contain the user’s username or email address.

Confirmation:

Users must enter their password twice to confirm correctness during registration or password changes.

Passwords are validated in real-time with a strength meter and requirement feedback.

Form submission is blocked until all requirements are satisfied.

System logs all password change attempts and successful changes, including:

Timestamp

Whether the password change was successful or just a visit

4. Password Reset

Password reset tokens are single-use and expire after a predefined time period.

Attempts to reuse an expired or already-used token are denied.

6. Compliance

Failure to comply with the password policy will result in rejection of the password and a prompt for the user to create a compliant password.
